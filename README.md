# Play

Ultralight, experimental media server.

## Features

- **Play any media, from any source**

Whether you have a huge library of high-resolution FLAC files or stream
everything, Play has it covered.

- **GraphQL**

In order to facilitate rich client application experiences, Play provides
a modern GraphQL API.

## Why?

Music and Film are forms of art, both largely emotional in nature.
Unfortunately, the experience of managing our content libraries isn't: too
often, technical concerns get in the way of enjoying content we can access.

Play is a new take on the concept of a home media server.
