An experiment in replacing Plex. Play is an ultralight media server, built by and for media enthusiasts. Made with passion and coffee in Colorado, USA.

## Goals

**Unify home media services**

For all but the most technical of audiophiles, home media can be a dark art. Play from Timbre aims to make administration of even multiple libraries (whether on disk or streaming) a breeze.

**Enable rich client experiences**

In order to support the next generation of rich music applications, Play provides a modern GraphQL API, full metadata support for most media container formats, and rich audio analysis to ensure the next track is always perfectly timed and not too loud.
